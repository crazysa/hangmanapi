# hangmanapi

This Repository is to train a LSTM such that it can predict the missing characters in a hangman problem.

1st file trains the model and stores it as .h5 file

second file does the guessing.

You can improve the model furthur if you increase the size of the training dataset by increasing the different hyperparameters and training size. due to limited compute resources I kept it as 1, 2 and len -1 for the training size .
kept the number of layers as 5000.
